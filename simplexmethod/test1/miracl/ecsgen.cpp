/*
 *   Proposed Digital Signature Standard
 *
 *   Elliptic Curve Variation GF(p) - See Dr. Dobbs Journal April 1997
 *
 *   This program generates one set of public and private keys in files 
 *   public.ecs and private.ecs respectively. Notice that the public key 
 *   can be much shorter in this scheme, for the same security level.
 *
 *   It is assumed that Curve parameters are to be found in file common.ecs
 *
 *   The curve is y^2=x^3+Ax+B mod p
 *
 *   The file common.ecs is presumed to exist, and to contain the domain
 *   information {p,A,B,q,x,y}, where A and B are curve parameters, (x,y) are
 *   a point of order q, p is the prime modulus, and q is the order of the 
 *   point (x,y). In fact normally q is the prime number of points counted
 *   on the curve. 
 *
 *   Requires: big.cpp elliptic.cpp
