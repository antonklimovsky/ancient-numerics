 *   Proposed Digital Signature Standard
 *
 *   Elliptic Curve Variation GF(2^m) - See Dr. Dobbs Journal April 1997
 *
 *   This program generates one set of public and private keys in files 
 *   public.ecs and private.ecs respectively. Notice that the public key 
 *   can be much shorter in this scheme, for the same security level.
 *
 *   It is assumed that Curve parameters are to be found in file common2.ecs
 *
 *   The curve is y^2+xy = x^3+Ax^2+B over GF(2^m) using a trinomial or 
 *   pentanomial basis (t^m+t^a+1 or t^m+t^a+t^b+t^c+1), these parameters
 *
 *   The file common2.ecs is presumed to exist and contain 
 *   {m,A,B,q,x,y,a,b,c} where A and B are parameters of the equation 
 *   above, (x,y) is an initial point on the curve, {m,a,b,c} are the field 
 *   parameters, (b is zero for a trinomial) and q is the order of the 
 *   (x,y) point, itself a large prime. The number of points on the curve is 
 *   cf.q where cf is the "co-factor", normally 2 or 4.
 * 
 *   Requires: big.cpp ec2.cpp
